<h3>Requirements:</h3>

VS Code (Dark Mode Theme)

<a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a>: v22.11.0 LTS

<a href="https://docs.expo.dev/">Expo Documentation</a>: Set up an Expo account, Download Expo Go on your mobile device, and make sure you have the latest version of Expo installed.

<h3>Initial Environment Setup:</h3>

<p>Run the following command: npx create-expo-app@latest --template</p>
<p>Select the Navigation (TypeScript) template and press Enter</p>
<p>Take all of the files from the repository, place them into your build, and click replace all duplicates.</p>
<p>Begin coding!</p>

<h3>How to test your current build:</h3>

<p>If you are on MacOS, install HomeBrew and run the command: brew install watchman</p>
<p>Open your terminal in VS Code and make sure you're in the project directory. Navigate using cd command and pwd command to check</p>
<p>Run this command to run: npx expo start --reset-cache</p>
<p>Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal using your camera and the current build will open on your phone using Expo Go.</p>
<p>Enjoy features including live edits, performance metrics, and many more.</p>

<h3>What to do if you run into an issue?</h3>
<p>I ran into many issues during my initial build. Luckily for us, React Native and Expo have millions of users and plenty of resources online. If you're encountering any issues, paste your command line error into your browser or ChatGPT and you will have the proper guidance to overcome any issues you may encounter. Feel free to reach out to me as well with any questions.</p>
