# Backend Test Report

## Testing Strategy

The TymeLyne backend uses Jest as the testing framework with the following testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and their interaction with the database
3. **Mocking**: Use Jest mocks to isolate components from their dependencies

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in the following structure:

```
__tests__/
  ├── unit/             # Unit tests for individual components
  │   ├── auth.controller.test.js
  │   ├── auth.middleware.test.js
  │   ├── db.config.test.js
  │   ├── email.service.test.js
  │   └── profile.model.test.js
  ├── integration/      # Integration tests for API endpoints
  │   └── auth.routes.test.js
  └── utils/            # Testing utilities
      ├── db-setup.js
      ├── email-mock.js
      └── mongoose-mock.js
```

## Test Summary

| Category | Test File | Description | Status |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **Unit** | auth.middleware.test.js | Tests authentication middleware | ✅ Passing |
| **Unit** | email.service.test.js | Tests email sending functionality | ✅ Passing |
| **Unit** | db.config.test.js | Tests database connection | ✅ Passing |
| **Unit** | auth.controller.test.js | Tests authentication controller functions | ⚠️ In Progress |
| **Unit** | profile.model.test.js | Tests profile model validation | ⚠️ In Progress |
| **Integration** | auth.routes.test.js | Tests authentication API endpoints | ⚠️ In Progress |

## Test Coverage

The current focus is on testing the core authentication system, including:

1. **Middleware**: JWT token verification - ✅ Fully tested
2. **Email Service**: Email verification functionality - ✅ Fully tested
3. **Database Configuration**: MongoDB connection handling - ✅ Fully tested
4. **Controllers**: User registration, login, and verification logic - ⚠️ In progress
5. **Models**: Profile schema validation - ⚠️ In progress

## Mocking Strategy

To ensure tests are reliable and don't depend on external services, the following mocking approach is used:

1. **Mongoose**: Mocked to avoid real database connections
   - Models include mock methods like `findOne`, `findById`, `select`, and `save`
   - Schema Types are mocked for data validation
2. **JWT**: Mocked to provide predictable token verification
3. **Nodemailer**: Mocked to test email sending without actual SMTP connections
4. **Crypto**: Mocked to provide consistent token generation and hash functions
5. **UUID**: Mocked to generate consistent user IDs for testing

## Running Tests

The following npm scripts are available to run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cd backend
npm test

# Run specific test suites
cd backend
npm run test:middleware  # Authentication middleware tests
npm run test:email       # Email service tests
npm run test:db          # Database config tests

# Run tests in watch mode
cd backend
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
cd backend
npm run test:coverage
```

## Known Issues

1. **Controller test issues**:
   - Tests for auth.controller have issues with the mocked database operations
   - Methods like `user.save()` need better mocking in the findOne results
   - Status codes in controller responses sometimes don't match expectations

2. **Integration test issues**:
   - The Express app integration with supertest requires better configuration
   - Content-Type and status code assertions often fail in integration tests

3. **MongoDB Schema Issues**:
   - Schema.Types.Mixed needs proper mocking to avoid undefined errors
   - Profile model validation tests need more reliable mocks

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining controller test issues:
   - Improve mongoose mocks to better handle save/update operations
   - Adjust test expectations based on actual controller behavior

2. Enhance integration tests:
   - Fix Express middleware setup to ensure proper Content-Type headers
   - Mock request/response cycle more effectively

3. Complete model tests:
   - Improve Profile model validation tests
   - Add tests for schema validations like email format and required fields

4. Add additional test cases:
   - Test edge cases for all authentication operations
   - Add error handling tests for network and database failures
