# FINAL PROFILE FIX GUIDE

Follow these steps to fix all profile update and display issues:

## Step 1: Run the SQL scripts in this order

1. First, run `frontend/src/services/sql/update_avatar_function.sql` to ensure the avatar update function exists:
   ```sql
   -- This adds a function to update avatar URLs
   [Navigate to the SQL Editor in Supabase and paste the contents of update_avatar_function.sql]
   ```

2. Run `frontend/src/services/sql/update_mime_types.sql` to update allowed MIME types for avatars:
   ```sql
   -- This allows common image formats in the avatars bucket
   SELECT public.update_avatars_mime_types(ARRAY['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']);
   
   -- This resets all storage policies to ensure proper access
   SELECT public.reset_storage_policies();
   ```

## Step 2: Install Required Packages

Make sure your app has all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install expo-file-system
```

This package is required for avatar image caching.

## Step 3: Fix Profile Display Issues

### Fixed Issues:

1. **Profile Updates Not Showing in UI:**
   - ✅ The application now automatically refreshes profile data after updates
   - ✅ Avatar uploads have been improved to handle various image formats
   - ✅ Local preview is shown immediately for better user experience

2. **Avatar Upload Issues:**
   - ✅ Added support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
   - ✅ Improved error handling during uploads
   - ✅ Added image preview functionality
   - ✅ Added local caching for avatars to prevent disappearing on app restart

3. **Profile Form Issues:**
   - ✅ Fixed issues with form values not updating after server changes
   - ✅ Improved validation and error messaging

4. **Image Loading Issues:**
   - ✅ Fixed repeated failures to load avatars with multiple fallback systems
   - ✅ Added verification of cached files before using them
   - ✅ Limited retry attempts to prevent infinite loading loops
   - ✅ Added cache busting to URL parameters to ensure fresh content
   - ✅ Added direct file download functionality as a fallback mechanism
   - ✅ Improved image rendering with progressive loading and fade-in effects

## Step 4: How Avatar Caching Works

The application now uses a multi-layered approach to ensure avatars persist across app restarts:

1. **Local Preview:** Immediately after selecting an image, it's displayed as a preview
2. **Local Caching:** Images are downloaded and cached in the device's filesystem
3. **Database URL:** The avatar URL is stored in the profile database
4. **Fallback System:** If an image fails to load, the app will:
   - Try the cached version first
   - Verify the cached file exists and has valid content
   - Attempt to download the image directly to a local file
   - If that fails, attempt to refresh the profile and download again
   - Show a default avatar if all else fails
   - Limit retries to prevent endless loading loops
   - Add cache busting to prevent loading the same broken image

## Step 5: How to Upload a Profile Picture

1. Tap the avatar image on your profile page
2. Select an image from your photo library
3. The image will be immediately displayed as a preview
4. The upload will happen automatically in the background
5. If successful, you'll see a success message
6. If it fails, you'll see an error message but the preview will remain

## Troubleshooting

If you still have issues with your profile:

1. Force a profile refresh by pulling down on the Profile screen
2. If avatar uploads fail, try these steps:
   ```sql
   -- Run these in the Supabase SQL Editor
   SELECT public.reset_storage_policies();
   SELECT public.update_avatars_mime_types();
   ```
3. Check that your image is one of the supported formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP)
4. Ensure your network connection is stable during uploads
5. If your avatar disappears after app restart, check:
   - That Supabase Storage bucket permissions are correctly set
   - That your image is properly uploaded to the Storage bucket
   - That network connectivity is available to download the image
6. If multiple refresh attempts still fail:
   - Clear your app's cache in your device settings
   - Try uploading a smaller image (under 2MB)
   - Check your network connectivity settings
   - Ensure your device has sufficient storage space

## Technical Details

The avatar upload process has been completely redesigned to:
1. Use FormData for more reliable uploads
2. Include proper MIME type detection
3. Provide immediate visual feedback
4. Cache avatars locally using expo-file-system
5. Handle network and permission errors gracefully
6. Validate avatar URLs during profile load
7. Automatically refresh problematic avatar URLs
8. Implement a multi-tier caching system for maximum reliability
9. Add cache-busting parameters to prevent loading stale content
10. Directly download image files as a fallback mechanism
11. Limit retry attempts to prevent infinite loading cycles
12. Use progressive image rendering for a better user experience
